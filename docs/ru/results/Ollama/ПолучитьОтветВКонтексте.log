  "content": "The first version of 1C:Enterprise was released in 2004. However, it was not named 1C:Enterprise but rather 1C Accounting beforehand. This was done to differentiate the software from its predecessor, 1C Accounting. The original version was also known as 1C Professional, and later on as 1C:Pro or 1C:E, depending on the edition of the software being used. \n\nThe first official release of 1C:Enterprise under the new name came in 2009 with the release of version 5.7. This is also known as the \"Enterprise\" edition and it includes all features of the previous editions, except for some additional tools. The next major version, 6.1, was released in 2012 with several new features and enhancements to existing ones. It was then followed by other versions such as 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, etc., which came out periodically over time. In general, the latest version of 1C:Enterprise is the current one for each edition, with updates being provided on a regular basis."
