However, since then, several versions have been released over the years, each with enhancements and improvements to its functionality, user experience, and overall features. Recent versions include 1C:Enterprise 11, which has a redesigned user interface, improved reporting capabilities, and enhanced security features. These updates are often rolled out through regular software updates or through an installation process that provides automatic patches to users."
