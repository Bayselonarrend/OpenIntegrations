  "content": "1C:Enterprise was launched as a completely new software solution with a completely redesigned user interface in mid-2013. The original software product, originally named 1C-ERP (Electronic Resource Planning), was developed and released by SAP Labs, Germany, in 1987. The first version of the software was released in December 1989 as an engineering project at SAP Labs. In 1990, SAP Labs officially launched the product with a user interface named \"SAP II,\" which was based on SAP's mainframe system. A later version of 1C:Enterprise was released in 2012 and is commonly referred to as \"Version 5.\" As of the most recent update, Version 6.3, it continues to be a widely used software product by many organizations around the world."
