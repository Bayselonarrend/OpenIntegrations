However, typically new releases of software applications are usually rolled out with an extended support period (usually 1-2 years) and include bug fixes, improvements to functionality, and new features. The exact release date may vary depending on the version and its unique features and functionalities. In general, the earliest releases of software tend to be more stable and secure than later versions, so it's best to check the product documentation or contact the vendor for more information on specific versions and their release dates."
