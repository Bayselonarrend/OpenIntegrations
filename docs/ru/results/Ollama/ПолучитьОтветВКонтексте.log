  "content": "The first version of 1C:Enterprise was released in 2004. However, due to the platform's extensive development history and user base, subsequent versions have been made available over time through upgrades or new releases, with some newer versions being released on a quarterly basis or semi-annually. The most recent version of 1C:Enterprise is currently in release, which means it has not yet reached the end of its development cycle and is still under active development by CPAM."
