  "content": "I do not have access to specific information on when a particular product's release was relased. However, based on general trends in software development and industry best practices, most major software companies release a new version of their products at least once a year, if not more frequently. This cycle allows for ongoing improvements and bug fixes while also ensuring that the software remains relevant and current among users. The exact timing may vary depending on various factors such as product complexity, market demand, and feedback from customers and stakeholders."
