However, based on the description provided by cpm software, inc., a leading provider of 1c:enterprise software solutions, it is likely that the first version was released as early as 2008 or 2009. However, their website does not provide specific release dates for each version, so it's best to check their official website or contact them directly for information on specific versions of 1c:enterprise that have been released."
