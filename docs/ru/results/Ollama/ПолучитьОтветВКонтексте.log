  "content": "The first version of 1C:Enterprise was released in 1986. However, due to various reasons such as technical difficulties, cost issues, and market trends, it took several years for the company to make significant improvements and updates to the software. In 2003, 1C Company introduced a new version of 1C:Enterprise as part of its efforts to stay competitive in the market. It was eventually released as version 4.5 in 2004 and received further updates until it was finally discontinued in 2007 due to the emergence of newer enterprise software products that were more user-friendly and efficient."
