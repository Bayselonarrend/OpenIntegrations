However, it was eventually replaced by a later version (known as 1C:Enterprise 6) in April 2012 due to several significant changes and improvements made to the platform. The major difference between 1C:Enterprise 6 and earlier versions is that it includes more features and functionalities, as well as improvements to user experience, ease of use, and scalability."
