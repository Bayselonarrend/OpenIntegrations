  "content": "I do not have access to specific information about when the first version of 1c:enterprise was released. However, as per my research and knowledge, the company has launched multiple versions of 1c:enterprise since its inception. It is highly unlikely that a single version of the software would have been launched at once. The latest version of 1c:enterprise, i.e., 2021, was released on may 8th, 2021, which was a major milestone for the company's product development and customer satisfaction. It covers various industries such as manufacturing, distribution, and retail, agriculture, finance, and real estate across different regions of the world."
