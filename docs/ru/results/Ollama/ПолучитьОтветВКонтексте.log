  "content": "The first version of 1C:Enterprise was released in 2001. However, it did not have an official release date due to its rapid development cycle and release process. In 2004, a new version, 1C:Web, was released with additional features like cloud-based deployment, automated data synchronization, and other web-ready capabilities. The first public beta of the 1C:Enterprise software was also made available in 2008. In 2015, a major update named \"1C:Cloud\" was released that allowed enterprises to deploy 1C:Enterprise as a cloud-based service, removing some of its complexity and enabling faster implementation time. This version is still available as of 2021."
