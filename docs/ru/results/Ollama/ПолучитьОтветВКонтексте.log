  "content": "The first version of 1C:Enterprise was released in 1995. It has been widely used since then for accounting applications and continues to be improved and maintained by its developer, EMC Corporation. As for specific dates, it's hard to give exact dates because 1C:Enterprise is a widely used software and its features have expanded over the years. Its current version is v23 which was released in 2021, so we would recommend checking the product's official website or contacting their support team for more information on the latest updates and versions."
