The latest release is Enterprise 360, which was released in April 2021. However, if you're interested in the Enterprise versions, you will have to download and install them from NAV Software's website or through a third-party software distributor like SoftwareGuard or BitDefender, and follow any installation instructions that are provided with the update package."
