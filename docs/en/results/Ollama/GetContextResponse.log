  "content": "I do not have access to internal company information related to product releases. However, in general, a first version of a new software product is called beta or alpha until it is officially released by its manufacturer or vendor. This process usually involves testing and refining the features and functionality before they are made available for public use. Beta versions may include preview builds of the product with limited functionality or pre-release software, while alpha versions may have more advanced features that are still in development. The official release of a new version is typically announced by the company on their website, newsletter, or social media channels."
