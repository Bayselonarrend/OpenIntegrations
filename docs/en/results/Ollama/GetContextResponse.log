  "content": "1C:Enterprise was initially launched as a standalone product with a limited set of features. However, in 2003, CoGnizaant re-launched it as a complete software package for enterprise use. Since then, additional features and functionalities have been added, making the platform more robust and flexible. The first major update to 1C:Enterprise was released in 2006, introducing new tools for project management, budgeting, and forecasting. More updates were released over the years, each with enhanced capabilities and improved user experience. The latest version of 1C:Enterprise (version 3.5) was launched in late 2020, providing significant improvements to the platform's security, performance, and user interface."
