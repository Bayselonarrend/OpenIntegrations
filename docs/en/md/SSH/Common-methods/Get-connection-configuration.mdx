# Get connection configuration
 Forms a complete structure of connection settings that can be used instead of the actual connection when calling other functions



`Function GetConnectionConfiguration(Val SSHSettings, Val Proxy = Undefined) Export`

  | Parameter | CLI option | Type | Required | Description |
  |-|-|-|-|-|
  | SSHSettings | --set | Structure Of KeyAndValue | &#x2714; | SSH settings |
  | Proxy | --proxy | Structure Of KeyAndValue | &#x2716; | Proxy settings, if required. See GetProxySettings |

  
  Returns:  Structure Of KeyAndValue - Connection settings structure

<br/>

:::tip
Can be passed as the `Connection` parameter in other functions instead of the actual connection from the `CreateConnection` function.

At the same time, a new connection will be opened and closed within the called function

It is not recommended to use the connection configuration for multiple requests to the SSH server. This functionality is primarily intended for the CLI version of OInt, where maintaining a connection between calls is not possible
