# AWS S3 (MinIO)

This section covers the library for working with the AWS S3 API in 1C:Enterprise, OneScript, and CLI. This page describes all the actions required to get started.

:::important

**S3** is a standard used by various software products. This means that the availability of methods, as well as their parameters, may differ depending on the specific software being used. MinIO-based object storage is used for the development and testing of this library.

:::

## Getting Started

1. Obtain the following authorization data for working with S3:

    + Access key
    + Secret key
    + Region
    + Server URL
    + Service type (default is S3)

2. Pass the received data to the `GetDataStructure` function and obtain the main data structure.

```bsl title="1C:Enterprise/OneScript"

    URL       = "storage-155.s3hoster.by";
    AccessKey = "BRN5RKJE67...";
    SecretKey = "NNhv+i9PrytpT8Tu0C1N...";
    Region    = "BTC";

    MainData = OPI_S3.GetDataStructure(URL, AccessKey, SecretKey, Region);

```

```bash title="CLI"

    oint s3 GetDataStructure 
        --url "storage-155.s3hoster.by"
        --access "BRN5RKJE67..."
        --secret "NNhv+i9PrytpT8Tu0C1N..."
        --region "BTC"

```

The obtained structure (or JSON file) should be used to call other methods for working with the S3 API (parameter `MainData`). Authorization data and additional request settings will be determined based on this structure.

## Response Format

This library uses its own response format to provide data returned from the server. The format is as follows:

```json

{
    "status": 200,
    "response": {},
    "headers": {}
}

```

+ The **status** field contains the HTTP response status code.
+ The **response** field contains the body of the original S3 response, converted from XML to JSON.
+ The **headers** field contains the headers from the original response.

This is implemented to simplify working with the library, since the XML format is more cumbersome and complex compared to JSON.
