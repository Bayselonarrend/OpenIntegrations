# S3 (MinIO)

:::important

S3 - is a standard used by different software products. This means that the availability of methods, as well as their parameters, may differ depending on what software you are using. MinIO-based object storage is used to develop and test this library

:::

This section is dedicated to the library for working with AWS S3 API. On this page, all the steps necessary to start working are described

## Getting started

1. Obtain the following authorization data to work with S3:

    + Access key
    + Secret key
    + Region
    + Storage URL
    + Type of service (by default - S3)

2. Pass the received data to the `GetDataStructure` function and get the structure of the basic data

```bsl title="1ะก:Enterprise/OneScript"

    URL       = "storage-155.s3hoster.by";
    AccessKey = "BRN5RKJE67...";
    SecretKey = "NNhv+i9PrytpT8Tu0C1N...";
    Region    = "BTC";

    BasicData = OPI_S3.GetBasicDataStructure(URL, AccessKey, SecretKey, Region);

```

```bash title="CLI"

    oint s3 GetBasicDataStructure 
        --url "storage-155.s3hoster.by"
        --access "BRN5RKJE67..."
        --secret "NNhv+i9PrytpT8Tu0C1N..."
        --region "BTC"

```

3. Use the resulting structure (or JSON) to call other methods of working with S3 API (`BasicData` parameter)
