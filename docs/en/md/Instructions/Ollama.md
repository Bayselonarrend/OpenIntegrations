# Ollama

This section covers the library for working with Ollama in 1C:Enterprise, OneScript, and CLI. This page describes all the steps required to get started.

## Getting Started

1. Download Ollama from the [official website](https://ollama.com/) and run it on the target machine.
2. `(optional)` To enable uploading your own models to Ollama servers, you also need to create an account and add a public key to your local solution, following the instructions in the [Ollama keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys) section.
3. `(optional)` To enable authorization and allow handling external requests, you need to configure proxying through a third-party web server.

> By default, the Ollama server is only available on the local network at `localhost:11434`
