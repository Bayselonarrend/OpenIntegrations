## About implemented methods

This library has two parts: basic methods, like connecting and executing SQL queries, and a small ORM for common operations like CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and so on. Working through the ORM and through the query texts executed through the `ExecuteSQLQuery()` function is technically the same: the ORM simply generates the SQL query text based on the layouts, but then also calls them through this function

By default, all SELECT queries return an array of selected data, while other queries return only `true` in the `result` field on success, or `false` and error text in the `result` and `error` fields, respectively. To execute queries that require data to be returned but are not SELECT queries, the `ExecuteSQLQuery()` function has a `ForceResult` parameter

## "BLOB" type fields

This library can process fields of type BLOB (Binary Data). To place a value in a field of this type during INSERT or UPDATE, it can be passed either as a variable of type `BinaryData` (in 1C and OneScript) or as a structure of type `{"blob":File Path}` (in 1C, OneScript and CLI versions). Binary data is always returned as `{"blob":Base64 string}`.

## Compatibility

Technically, the client implementation is a Native component in Rust. It comes in a zip archive format, and, in theory, should work on all available platforms: x86 and x64 Windows and Linux. The actual testing was done on Windows x64 and, cossentially (via OneScript), on Linux x64
