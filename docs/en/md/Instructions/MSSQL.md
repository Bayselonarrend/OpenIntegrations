## About implemented methods

This library has two parts: basic methods, like connecting and executing SQL queries, and a small ORM for common operations like CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and so on. Working through the ORM and through the query texts executed through the `ExecuteSQLQuery()` function is technically the same: the ORM simply generates the SQL query text based on the layouts, but then also calls them through this function

By default, all SELECT queries return an array of selected data, while other queries return only `true` in the `result` field on success, or `false` and error text in the `result` and `error` fields, respectively. To execute queries that require data to be returned but are not SELECT queries, the `ExecuteSQLQuery()` function has a `ForceResult` parameter

## TLS

The library supports operation in TLS mode. To enable it, you need to configure TLS settings using the `GetTlsSettings` function and pass them as the corresponding parameter to the `CreateConnection` function or one of the ORM functions that support this parameter. If the TLS parameter is not provided when calling these functions, the connection will be initialized in an unsecured mode.

:::tip 
TLS settings can only be applied when the connection is established â€” either explicitly when using the `CreateConnection` function or implicitly when passing a connection string to ORM methods. Providing TLS settings along with an already established connection (passed via the *Connection* parameter) will be ignored. :::

## Compatibility

Technically, the client implementation is a Native component in Rust. It comes in a zip archive format, and, in theory, should work on all available platforms: x86 and x64 Windows and Linux. The actual testing was done on Windows x64 and, cossentially (via OneScript), on Linux x64
