# CDEK

This section covers the library for working with the CDEK API in 1C:Enterprise, OneScript, and CLI. This page describes all the steps required to get started.

## Getting Started

1. Sign an agreement with CDEK or use test credentials to get started. Learn more [on the documentation page](https://api-docs.cdek.ru/29923849.html)
2. Use the obtained **Account** and **Secure password** to create a Token using the `GetToken` method

A **Token** has a limited lifetime, during which it can be used in calls to other library methods. After it expires, you can obtain a new one by passing the Account and Secure password to the `GetToken` method again.
