# Melezh  

The server version of the Open Integration Package, providing a unified configurable HTTP API for accessing any of its libraries with default value settings, a web console, and built-in request logging.  

## How it works  

This server is based on oint - the console application of the Open Integrations Package, and allows remote invocation of its methods via HTTP requests from anywhere, just as it would happen in the console on a local machine. Melezh uses the Kestrel server built into OneScript to receive HTTP requests, which are then interpreted into oint commands (or commands of extension modules) for further execution.

The solution features a flexible configuration system, enabling restrictions on available commands/methods and setting default parameter values for command execution. It includes a logging system and a built-in web console for convenient management.
