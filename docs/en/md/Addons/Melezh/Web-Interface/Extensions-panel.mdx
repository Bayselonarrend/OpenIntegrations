Next is the **Extensions Panel**.

## General View

![Extensions Panel](../../../../static/img/Docs/Melezh/en/21.png)

The extensions panel displays a list of connected user `.os` modules, their file paths on disk, and the number of methods successfully interpreted as functions for use in handlers.

In the top-right corner of the page, there are two action buttons:

+ The first button updates the extensions cache on the server. Since the list of extensions and their parameters is generated only once at server startup, this button allows refreshing the list after changes without restarting the server

+ The second button refreshes the displayed list of extensions with up-to-date information without reloading the page
