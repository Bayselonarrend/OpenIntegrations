This section describes how to start working with Melezh using the built-in web interface.

## Accessing the Web Interface

After creating and launching a project in the terminal (command line), you can continue its configuration in the built-in web interface. To access it, navigate to `localhost:<your port>/ui` in your browser, which will bring you to the password entry page:

![Login Page](../../../../static/img/Docs/Melezh/en/6.png)

The default password is `admin`. It can only be changed in console mode, as noted in the hint on the login page itself. After entering the password, you'll see the **main dashboard**:

![Main Dashboard](../../../../static/img/Docs/Melezh/en/7.png)

The main dashboard displays a brief server summary and recent events: startup time and number of processed requests, summary information about the last 30 events with options to view more details (via the *Actions* button at the end of each event row).

On the left side of the page is the navigation panel. The upper section contains links to different console panels:

The lower section contains the *Logout* button (which returns to the password entry screen) and additional links to external resources: the Melezh repository and current documentation:

The content and functionality of other panels will be described in the following documentation sections.
