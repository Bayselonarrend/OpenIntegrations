To start working with Melezh, you need to go through the installation procedure, after which you can create and configure a project. This section describes the process of installing Melezh on a specific device. The choice of one method or another depends on the operating system, as well as the availability of Docker or OneScript with the OPM package manager:

## Installation in a container (recommended)

The easiest way to run Melezh with all necessary dependencies is using Docker. This can be done in one of the following ways:

+ Get the image from GHCR and run the container:

```bash
    Instead of -deb you can specify -rpm to use rpm-based distribution
    Instead of -ru you can specify -en to get the English version
    Instead of latest you can specify a specific version of Melezh
    Port 1921 - main port of Melezh http-server
    Port 1931 - debug port for connecting OneScript Debug Adapter for VS Code during operation. See Debugging section for details
    
    docker pull ghcr.io/bayselonarrend/melezh:latest-deb-en
    docker run -d -p 1921:1921 -p 1931:1931 --name melezh ghcr.io/bayselonarrend/melezh:latest-deb-en
```

+ Download the zip archive with Dockerfile (`melezh-docker-ru.zip` or `melezh-docker-en.zip`) from the repository release on Github. The archive needs to be unpacked, after which you should run one of the installation scripts located there - `bat` or `sh`, depending on the OS being used

## Installation on local machine

You can also install Melezh as a OneScript package or application on a local machine in one of the following ways:

### OneScript

Melezh and OInt are primarily packages for [OneScript](https://github.com/EvilBeaver/OneScript), which can be installed using the OPM package manager. The Russian version of the package can be installed from the cloud package hub using the console command:

```bash
opm install melezh
```

This package already has dependencies on OInt and OInt CLI - they will be installed automatically 

In addition to getting from the cloud, both English and Russian versions can be installed from local `.ospx` package files, which are located in the releases of the corresponding repositories [Melezh](https://github.com/Bayselonarrend/OpenIntegrations) and [OpenIntegrations](https://github.com/Bayselonarrend/OpenIntegrations):

```bash
opm install -f oint-x.x.x_lang.ospx
opm install -f oint-cli-x.x.x_lang.ospx
opm install -f melezh-x.x.x_lang.ospx
```

:::warning
Each version of `melezh` is compatible with the corresponding version of `oint` provided the package languages match. For example, the Russian version of Melezh 0.8.0 is compatible with the Russian version of `oint` 1.31.0, version 0.9.0 - with 1.32.0, etc. The latest version of Melezh is always compatible with the latest version of `oint` and is always released simultaneously with it. When updating `melezh` to a newer version, the `oint` and `oint-cli` packages must also be updated. The same applies in reverse
:::

<hr/>

### Windows

Installing Melezh on Windows is done during the installation of `oint` - the main console application of the Open Integration Package. Simply download the `oint` installers from the [OpenIntegrations](https://github.com/Bayselonarrend/OpenIntegrations) repository release (v >= 1.24.0), then during installation, check the box on the page asking about additional Melezh installation:

<hr/>

### Linux

To install Melezh on devices with Linux OS, `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are available in the Melezh repository releases. Both depend on the `oint` package, which in corresponding (`.deb` or `.rpm`) variants can be found in the [OpenIntegrations](https://github.com/Bayselonarrend/OpenIntegrations) repository releases

As with OneScript packages, it is important to maintain correspondence of version numbers and language versions
