This section describes the initial launch and first steps after installing Melezh on your device.

## Launching

Regardless of the operating system or installation method, after completion, Melezh should be available in the terminal (command line) via the `melezh` command.

> On Windows, a reboot might be required, but you can also launch it directly via the Start menu shortcut.

When launched, you'll see the initial Melezh screen:

You can view all available Melezh methods by running `melezh --help`. Calling any Melezh method without parameters will display its purpose and argument list:

## Creating a Project

To begin working with Melezh, you need to create a **project** - a file that will store main settings and handler information. Use the `CreateProject` command and specify the save path in the `--path` argument:

## Project Configuration

Further project configuration can be done in two ways:

+ **Using the Command Line Interface**  
Configure the project by executing additional `melezh` commands in the terminal. Available commands and their arguments are listed in the *Command Line Interface* section and the built-in application help.

+ **Using the Web Interface**  
In addition to the CLI, Melezh includes a built-in Web UI for interactive project management. Learn more about the web interface in the *Web Interface* section.
