:::tip
The use of the `raw` feature is necessary for compound constructions like `BEETWEEN`. For example: with `raw:false` the filter `type:BETWEEN` `value:10 AND 20` will be interpolated as `BETWEEN ?1 `^^.

where `?1 = "10 AND 20,"' which would cause an error.

In such a case, you must use `raw:true` to set the condition directly in the query text
