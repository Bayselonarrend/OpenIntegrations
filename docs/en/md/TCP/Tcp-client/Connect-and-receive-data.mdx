:::tip
The method tries to read the data in intervals, the duration of which is specified in the AttemptDuration parameter. The Attempts parameter is responsible for the maximum number of attempts. If the new data is successfully received, the number of attempts is reset.

When working with an infinite stream of incoming data, it is obligatory to specify the MaxSize parameter, because infinite resetting of attempts when receiving data can lead to hangs
