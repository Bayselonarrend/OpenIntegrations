  | DisableCertVerification | --trust | Boolean | &#x2714; | Allows to work with invalid certificates, including self signed |
  | CertFilepath | --cert | String | &#x2716; | Path to the root PEM file of the certificate if it is not in the system repository |
  | Delay | --delay | Number | &#x2716; | Delay before closing the connection for proper TLS termination (ms)) |

Tls settings can only be set when a connection is created: explicitly, by using the `OpenConnection` function or implicit, when passing settings

The `Delay` can be increased for slow connections to avoid issues with proper TLS termination
