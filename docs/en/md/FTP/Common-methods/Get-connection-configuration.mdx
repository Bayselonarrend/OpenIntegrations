# Get connection configuration

`Function GetConnectionConfiguration(Val FTPSettings, Val Proxy = Undefined, Val Tls = Undefined) Export`

  | Parameter | CLI option | Type | Required | Description |
  |-|-|-|-|-|
  | FTPSettings | --set | Structure Of KeyAndValue | &#x2714; | FTP settings. See GetConnectionSettings |
  | Proxy | --proxy | Structure Of KeyAndValue | &#x2716; | Proxy settings, if required. See GetProxySettings |
  | Tls | --tls | Structure Of KeyAndValue | &#x2716; | TLS settings, if necessary. See GetTlsSettings |

  
  Returns:  Structure Of KeyAndValue - Connection settings structure

<br/>

:::tip
Can be passed as the `Connection` parameter in other functions instead of the actual connection from the `CreateConnection` function.

At the same time, a new connection will be opened and closed within the called function

Using the connection configuration is not recommended for multiple requests to the FTP server. This functionality is primarily intended for the CLI version of OInt, where maintaining a connection between calls is not possible
