:::tip
Tls settings can only be set when a connection is created: explicitly, by using the `OpenConnection` function or implicit, when passing the connection string to ORM methods.

Passing Tls settings together with passing an already created connection to the `Connection` parameter will be ignored

Tls settings can also be passed in the connection string
