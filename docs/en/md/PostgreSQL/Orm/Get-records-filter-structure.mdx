# Get records filter Structure
 Gets the template structure for filtering records in ORM queries



`Function GetRecordsFilterStructure(Val Clear = False) Export`

  | Parameter | CLI option | Type | Required | Description |
  |-|-|-|-|-|
  | Clear | --empty | Boolean | &#x2716; | True > structure with empty valuse, False > field descriptions at values |

  
  Returns:  Structure Of KeyAndValue - Record filter element

:::tip
The use of the `raw` feature is necessary for compound constructions like `BETWEEN`. For example: with `raw:false` the filter `type:BETWEEN` `value:10 AND 20` will be interpolated as `BETWEEN ?1 ` where `?1 = "10 AND 20,"' which would cause an error.. In such a case, you must use `raw:true` to set the condition directly in the query text
